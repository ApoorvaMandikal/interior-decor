# Interior Decor Website

This project was created using React and Tailwind CSS. It is an interior decorating website which I have built using a Figma design file.

## Description
The website currently is completely responsive, which can be used in desktop and mobile functionalities and contains React funtionalities such as Carousels.

## Updates
The website requires many updates, The navigation bar hamburger icons in "header" section and 
the "Products" are not working properly. And I plan to implement a filter functionality for the product section
